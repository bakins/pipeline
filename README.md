# pipeline

Experimentation with command pipelines.

This is an experiement and nothing more.

## Usage

see [simple.yaml](./simple.yaml) for an example pipeline.

Steps are defined commands to run. "plugins" can be used to add configuration options,
but all plugins simple return commands to be ran.
